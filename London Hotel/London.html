                Located in London’s West End, the Landon Hotel is at the heart of the city. The West End has something for everyone—from theater to dining to historic sights. And the not-to-miss Rooftop Cafe is a great place for travelers and locals to engage over drinks, food, and good conversation. Far from being solely a tourist hotel, the West End Landon is an important venue for the local community and meetings.
                </p>
    
                <h2>

                <p>
                Established 50 years ago, and thoroughly refurbished throughout, this is the Landon that started it all. The West End Landon prides itself on offering its guests an experience to treasure.
